# Capstone_Group8
The Maverick analysis conducted by Group 8 from the University of Utah is documented in this GitHub repository. Our collective goal revolves around the development of a sophisticated time series forecasting model, meticulously designed for precise daily sales predictions for 30 stores. Emphasizing strategic resource optimization, support for informed financial decisions, and the establishment of benchmarks for performance evaluation, this repository comprises Business Problem Statement, Python notebook files for data analysis and model development, and presentation  outlining project objectives, methodology, and outcomes. The culmination of our work aims to deliver a cutting-edge forecasting model, providing Maverik with accurate estimates for the first year of sales for its upcoming or new stores.
